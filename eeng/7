# Wi-Fi Network Monitoring Lesson

Hello everyone! How are you all doing?

Well, another lesson here. This time we're going to learn how we can monitor our wireless environment.

Let's enter our environment here. If you're already in any environment today, especially in big cities, large metropolises or in large areas, you'll obviously have a lot of Wi-Fi frequency saturation.

So, you can do this in any area, since nowadays Wi-Fi is more present than ever.

## Environment Configuration

Let's go back to our environment here. I'm in my Kali Linux running through my Ubuntu, but you can also do this through your terminal. No problem at all, ok?

I'll adjust here to make it better visible for you.

So let's see, first check if it's really in monitoring mode. So run an `iwconfig` to see if it's in monitor monitoring mode.

This is the first thing we'll have to check.

## Using Airodump-ng

With this now, we can use our Airodump. With Airodump, what can we do? Monitor our network.

Execute: `airodump-ng wlan0mon`

Let me go back here to our command: `airodump-ng wlan0mon` for monitoring mode.

It will keep monitoring our entire network here.

## Information Collected

This here is a very interesting and very important part. Why? Here we have various types of information that we'll use throughout our lessons.

### ESSID (Network Name)
Like, for example, here we have the name of each network. We already know this - the names of each network. When we're going to access a network, they all have names. Here we'll have the ESSID.

We have "CriamoLo" here. I have our "WiFi Teste" here that we can be using. There are others here too, like "VEM", which is the name of our network.

### Authentication Method
We have the authentication method. How is authentication done? Most nowadays is all through PSK, which is the most secure method.

### Encryption Type
The encryption type: WPA2 is the most used today. There's also WEP, but this is less secure. So this type of configuration will be much less used.

Some open networks, including "NET_CLARO_WIFI", is an open network, so it doesn't have a password. But for you to be able to browse, you need a login, if I'm not mistaken. So here there's another type of security.

### Channel and Power
The channel: generally they're also automatic. Here we have channel 1, channel 11, which is where our frequency is.

Amount of data that was transported from one to another, their power, the power of each signal. The smaller the better: if it's -40, it's closer; when it gets to -80, it's even farther away.

So, the higher the value (closer to zero), the better; the lower (more negative), the worse. This is the logic of our power. Since it has a negative sign, the closer to zero, the better it gets; the farther away (more negative), the worse it gets.

### MAC Address
And here we have our MAC Address too. We'll work a lot with these MAC Addresses in these lessons too.

In the lessons to come, we'll work quite a bit with these MAC Addresses here. These MAC Addresses here are the MAC Addresses of the routers - called BSSID.

So they all have our MAC Address here, and down here we have some important information.

### Connected Devices
Like, for example, we have the MAC Addresses of our routers and the MAC Addresses of devices that are connected to these routers.

So, ending in 98F2, we have the WiFi here, and we have some hosts: cell phones, notebooks, anyway, any type of Wi-Fi connection. We can see that they're listed here with our MAC Address, as you can see here.

But we have others too, like 4A43, which is this other router here. I'm here in an environment with few Wi-Fi connections, but you, if you're in a quite voluminous connection, with quite a lot of Wi-Fi, quite a lot of routers, will be able to see quite a lot.

### Additional Information
So here we have the power of our connection, if there's some type of lost packet, if there are some type of lost packets - we can also see this here, which is also quite important.

## Channel Filtering

This here is the basic part of being able to monitor. If I want to monitor, for example, a specific channel, I can monitor a single channel to filter this, which also helps a lot and is very important.

To exit the screen, press Ctrl+C to be able to exit our screen here, and let's try to configure here, for example, a specific channel.

It's the same command: Airodump, we can complement here:
`airodump-ng wlan0mon -c 1`

For example, then we'll filter. Here, look, channel 1, do you see? So we filtered only this type of connection, which makes it easier to choose your target, for example.

## BSSID Filtering

This is important to configure. We can still filter by our BSSID, filter by a specific router.

So, for example, let's filter here by our router, let's filter this little router of ours here.

Ctrl+C to exit. The same command, you can filter by our channel, if you want, or by our BSSID.

So let's use here as command:
`airodump-ng wlan0mon -c 1 --bssid [MAC_ADDRESS]`

There you go. So here we have only one, so it will only list only one single access point, and all its connections that are connected to it.

## Conclusion

Folks, this here is a phase - we're still at the very beginning, but it's important that you know all these types of techniques, because they will be used later in the more advanced lessons.

Well, so folks, that's it. We'll continue here to our next lesson.

A hug to everyone!
